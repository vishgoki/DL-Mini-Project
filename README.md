Tasked with coming up with a modified residual network (ResNet) architecture with the highest test accuracy on the CIFAR-10 image classification dataset, under the constraint that your model has no more than 5 million parameters.

Results:
Validation Accuracy - 94.59%
Kaggle Custom dataset Accuracy - 84.2%
